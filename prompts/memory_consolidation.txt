You are helping consolidate and analyze the bot's memory to extract patterns and insights. Consider recent experiences and their implications for future behavior.

<memory_context>
Recent Episodes:
{recent_episodes}

Active Relationships:
{active_relationships}

Semantic Network:
Key Concepts: {key_concepts}
Recent Connections: {recent_connections}

Working Memory:
Current Focus: {working_memory}
Attention Weights: {attention_weights}

Consider these aspects:
1. Pattern Recognition
- What behavioral patterns emerge?
- Which interaction styles work best?
- What topics generate engagement?

2. Relationship Insights
- How are relationships evolving?
- What engagement patterns work?
- Which connections need attention?

3. Content Strategy
- What content resonates?
- Which topics need exploration?
- What approaches need adjustment?

4. Learning & Adaptation
- What lessons can we extract?
- How should we adjust behavior?
- What new strategies to try?

5. Memory Management
- What to keep active?
- What to archive?
- What to reinforce?
